# LLMs: More Than Just The Basics

These materials are designed to power roughly 8 hours of class time focused on demystifying LLM technology for people who have no software background whatsoever. There are four broad segments:

1. Technical details about LLMs. (lecture driven)
    * How they are constructed.
    * How they are trained and that process works.
    * Strengths and limitations that stem from these decisions.

2. Case Studies. (discussion driven)
    * Actual examples of LLMs that have been deployed, and what happened as a result.
    * How things can go poorly.
    * How things can go well.
    * How to mitigate errors.

3. The current corporate and academic landscape related to LLM technology. (research driven)
    * Who is performing research?
    * What kinds of LLM products and services are there?
        * Who is providing which kinds of LLM services?
    * Impact and politics around open and closed models.

4. Using LLMs. (exercise driven)
    * Prompt strategies
    * Lots of practice

## For Instructors:

* Files are named to indicate the order in which they should be delivered. 
* Any markdown files are lecture notes, written with the expectation that you'll have a (digital) blackboard available where you can illustrate many of the concepts in the lecture.
    * If you won't have that, you may wish to create some diagrams or slides to accompany the lesson plans.
* Periodically there are "micro" and "mini" exercises embedded in the markdown and Python files.
    * Micro exercises should take about 1-2 minutes to complete.
    * Mini exercises should take about 5 minutes to complete. 
* There are also a variety of "full" exercises.
    * Exercises in this repo describe their own timing expectations.
