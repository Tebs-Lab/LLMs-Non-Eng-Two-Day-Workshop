# Case Studies Instructions

For each of the case studies in this section you'll be broken into small groups and asked to answer some questions. You'll have about 15 minutes for this, if you finish early return to the main room.

## Setup

Each case study comes with at least one article. The instructor will introduce the highlights, but you may wish to skim the articles as well. That said, try to focus on the discussion more than the article -- wrestling with the topics directly will accelerate your learning. 

## Questions to Always Ask

Individual case studies may pose some additional questions, but for every case study discuss the following questions:

* Identify which aspects of this system are controlled by a ...
    * Model
    * Agent
    * Application
    * Keep in mind that all examples will involve at least one model, but any given example may or may not involve an agent or an application.

* What kind of fine-tuning might have been done on this model?
    * What might the data for that training be?

* What are the sources of error that caused the system to fail this way?
    * Additionally or alternately, what kinds of failure and risk could arise from a system like this, and what might cause those failures to occur?
    * Keep in mind there are generally multiple sources of error.

* How might you attempt to mitigate these failures?
    * Not all errors can be solved, but try to come up with a solution or mitigation anyway!
    * You can always decide that such a strategy isn't good enough to justify publishing the system.
