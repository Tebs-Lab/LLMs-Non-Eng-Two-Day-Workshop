# Woebot, A Chatbot For Mental Health

Article: [https://spectrum.ieee.org/woebot](https://spectrum.ieee.org/woebot)

## At A Glance

Woebot is a chatbot designed to give therapeutic advice rooted in the practice of a well-known, highly researched therapeutic methodology called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Historically, the creators of Woebot have avoided generative LLM technology, opting for something that is much closer to a phone-tree of options. Here's a quote from the article:

> Woebot, which is currently available in the United States, is not a generative-AI chatbot like ChatGPT. The differences are clear in both the botâ€™s content and structure. Everything Woebot says has been written by conversational designers trained in evidence-based approaches who collaborate with clinical experts; ChatGPT generates all sorts of unpredictable statements, some of which are untrue. Woebot relies on a rules-based engine that resembles a decision tree of possible conversational paths; ChatGPT uses statistics to determine what its next words should be, given what has come before. 


## Some Additional Considerations

While LLMs are most widely used for generative AI, Woebot uses LLMs for classification and regression problems. Here's another snip from the article:

> While everything Woebot says is written by humans, NLP techniques are used to help understand the feelings and problems users are facing; then Woebot can offer the most appropriate modules from its deep bank of content. When users enter free text about their thoughts and feelings, we use NLP to parse these text inputs and route the user to the best response.

* How does this methodology change the risk profile and failure pattern for Woebot's creators?

Here's another snip:

> Ultimately, we decided to expand our platform by implementing our own LLM prompt-execution engine, which gave us the ability to inject LLMs into certain parts of our existing rules-based system.

* Considering the therapeutic setting, what advantages and risks might this hybrid methodology introduce?
