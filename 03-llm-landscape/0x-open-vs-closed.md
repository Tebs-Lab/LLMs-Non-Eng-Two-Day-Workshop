# Open and Closed Models

A major debate in the AI/ML community is focused on open vs closed research and models. This section is about that debate. For all of the following research sections, keep in mind that there are a lot of different kinds of "open" models. In particular, consider the following situations:

* The model architecture is published, but nothing else.
* The model architecture and parameter values are published, but nothing else.
* The model architecture, parameters, training data and procedures are published.
* Other combinations are possible (e.g. published architecture and training data without training procedure and without parameter values.)
* None of the above is published, a "closed" model.

When answering the research questions, keep in mind that the answers probably change depending on which of these situations is applicable.

As a starting point for all of these questions, consider these two articles from IEEE Spectrum:

* [Open-Source AI Is Uniquely Dangerous](https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-ai-2666932122)
* [Open-Source AI Is Good for Us](https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-ai-good)

## Research Benefits & Organizations

* In terms of accelerating research, how would you value these different aspects of openness. Which are most important? Which are least important? Why?:
    * Model architectures
    * Model weights (note: architecture must be open for open weights to be useful)
    * Training procedures
    * Training data

* Which of the above situations allow for reproducibility, if any?

* In terms of accelerating research, make the best argument you can that open models are good.

* In terms of accelerating research, make the best argument you can that closed models are good. 

* Based on public statements and data available to you, classify the following organizations in terms of what kind aspects of their models are "open" vs "closed"
    * OpenAI
    * Meta
    * Google
    * Anthropic
    * xAI (Grok)

* Describe the company Hugging Face's role in open source ML.

## Risks & Reward

* Define at least 3 risks that are (arguably) unique to open models.
    * Once you've defined those risks, rank them from most to least risky.

* Define at least 3 risks that are (arguably) unique to closed models.
    * Once you've defined those risks, rank them from most to least risky.

* Define at least 3 benefits that are (arguably) unique to open models.
    * Once you've defined those benefits, rank them from most to least beneficial.

* Define at least 3 benefits that are (arguably) unique to closed models.
    * Once you've defined those benefits, rank them from most to least beneficial.

* Now that you've had a chance to really think through the risks and rewards...
    * Make your best argument that models should be open.
    * Make your best argument that models should be closed.
    * Name any caveats you think are important in each case. 

## Politics, Economics, and Regulation

* The United States and the EU have both passed some forms of regulation that impact LLMs
    * In the EU the latest example is the AI Act: https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/
    * In the US the latest example is the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence  : https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/

* For each of these regulations, how are open and closed models treated differently?
* Do either of these regulations *require* any degree of openness? If so, what are those requirements?

* Can you think of any benefits a corporation might gain from publishing open models and open datasets?
    * If not, why do you think Meta is pursuing this course?
    * If so, make the best case you can that it's still better to publish closed models.
