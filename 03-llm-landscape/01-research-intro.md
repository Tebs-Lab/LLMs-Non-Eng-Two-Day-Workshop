# Research Projects

In this section you're going to be asked to perform some research in small groups. Each group will be given a research topic, some guidelines, and some specific questions to answer. We'll call these "topic groups."

After a research period we'll change the groups such that each new group has at least one person from the previous groups (one representative for each topic). In these new groups the "topic experts" from the initial groups will each present their findings. We'll call these new groups "discussion groups."

## Some Suggestions

### In The Topic Groups

* Make a shared document that contains the questions and your team's answers.
* Include any other material you'd like to share in the discussion groups, such as:
    * Diagrams 
    * Especially helpful and compelling articles
    * New questions you now have
    * Share these resources with everyone else, and then everyone will have very helpful notes and reference material for later.

* Divide the work by question sets.
    * The pedagogical value of this type of exercise is that everyone can be actively learning at the same time (the opposite of a lecture, where everyone but the instructor is passive).
    * There will be some overlap, but we've tried to ask sets of questions that can be researched independently. 

* Leave time for debate and discussion within your topic group before we move to discussion groups.
    * All of the topics have a degree of controversy, nuance, and tradeoffs.
    * Many of the questions do not have "objective" answers.

### In The Discussion Groups

* Be mindful of the time.
    * There should be enough time to discuss every topic, but you won't have enough time to discuss every detail that came up in the topic groups. 

* Look for, and call out, connections between topics.
    * One purpose of this exercise is to get a better sense of the ML ecosystem -- connections are critical.
