# Prompt Engineering Practice

In this section you have choices about what to practice. There are 4 exercise descriptions and you'll likely have enough time to work on 2 of them.

## Setup

1. You'll be asked to pick one of the available exercises.
2. You'll be given some time to work individually on that exercise.
3. You'll be put into a group with other people who worked on the same exercise you did, and asked to share your work, and discuss what you learned.
4. We'll repeat this process at least one more time.
