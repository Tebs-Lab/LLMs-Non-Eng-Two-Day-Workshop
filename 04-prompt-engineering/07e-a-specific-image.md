# Generating A Specific Image

Sometimes it's hard to get these models to produce something highly specific. Lets try!

## Setup

1. Pick an image, it can be anything, but don't "imagine" an image, find an actual image you want to try and recreate. 
2. Try to write a prompt that will produce something very similar to the image in question.
3. Iterate on your prompt a few times, try to make small changes to steer the generator closer to your desired output.
4. Repeat this process a few times.
