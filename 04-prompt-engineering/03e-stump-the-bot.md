# Stump The Bot

Pick a topic with which you are very familiar, then try to get the bot making a mistake while talking about that topic. Repeat this process a few times with different topics. Try starting with a topic that is mainstream and well understood, then move to more esoteric topics.

## Some tips:

1. Current models are excellent writers but their reasoning skills are still generally a weakness. Ask the bot to make inferences based on facts.
2. Current models have "approximate knowledge of many things" but will sometimes get simple facts wrong because they're predicting "likely next words" not "remembering facts."
3. Tell the bot it's wrong even when it's right, sometimes the results are interesting.
4. Get more and more specific and esoteric, LLMs tend to perform better on widespread knowledge.
5. Target popular misconceptions, as statistical learners the more prevalent some piece of misinformation is the more likely the LLM is to repeat it.
6. Ask it to do something that requires several steps of reasoning.
