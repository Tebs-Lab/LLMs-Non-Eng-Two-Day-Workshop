# Rough Draft Writer

A common use for LLMs is to write rough drafts and outlines. Lets put it to the test!

## Setup

1. Pick a topic with which your are familiar.
2. Ask the LLM to write an outline for an article on the topic.
    * Experiment with specifying length
    * Consider asking it to focus on a specific aspect of the topic
    * Consider asking for some specific style elements.
3. Take the outline and ask the LLM to produce an article based on the outline.
4. Audit the results
    * Did the outline highlight the right aspects of the topic?
    * Given your experience, does the outline make sense for the topic?
    * Did the LLM stick to the outline when drafting?
    * How is the quality of the writing?
    * Did it follow your style requests?
5. Repeat.
